#Using concepts of OOP create two classes Card and Deck 
# and create a method to shuffle the originally ordered deck. 
# Create another method to check whether a given set of cards are a pair. 
# For example: J, Q of hearts or 10, J of spades. 
# Pair checks for whether value is consecutive or cyclic such as in case of A, 1.
